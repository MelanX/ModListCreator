# ModListCreator

## How to use
1. Put the ModListCreator file into a folder
2. Extract the `manifest.json` file from an exported modpack file into the same folder
3. Run ModListCreator jar file
4. Wait for `modlist.html`

## Why use this instead of exported modlist?
- This tool sorts the project names alphabetically
- This tool links to the project and the author
- The official `modlist.html` contains broken links to the projects
